# Sliders Nigeria Deployment

Sliders is a web-based analytics platform designed for stakeholders including government officials, researchers, and policymakers who develop insurance programs. This deployment serves as a public demonstration of the DESDR system, adapted for `Nigeria`. It utilizes actual data from Chirps and Nigeria's administrative regions. The included queries demonstrate the potential for complex real-world data analysis but are illustrative and may differ from those used in full operational deployment.
